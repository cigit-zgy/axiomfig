## Installation

This package is meant to be installed automatically by TeXLive, MikTeX, etc.
Otherwise, XCharter-Math can be installed under TEXMFHOME or TEXMFLOCAL, f.i.
XCharter-Math.otf in directory texmf-local/fonts/opentype/public/xcharter-math/
and fourier-otf.sty in directory  texmf-local/tex/latex/xcharter-math/.
Documentation files and their sources can go to directory
texmf-local/doc/fonts/public/xcharter-math/

Don't forget to rebuild the file database (mktexlsr or so) if you install
under TEXMFLOCAL.

Finally, make the system font database aware of the XCharter Math font
(fontconfig under Linux).

    U+1D400-U+1D7F5 (SE#688363 for KPfonts).

  - Inconsistencies between Bold Caligraphic glyphs and their Regular
    counter-parts fixed.
  - Superscripts redesigned.
  - Inconsistencies between vertical delimiter sizes fixed.

  - mcal (Chancery) variants of mscr (Round hand) capitals can be accessed
  via variation selector U+FE00.

  - Inconsistencies in widehat, widetilde and other over/under accents fived.
* v0.74:
  - Variation Selector U-FE00 usage fixed: it works on script capitals
    (turned to Chancery style) and on all Math characters listed on
	https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/StandardizedVariants.txt
	except U+2A3C, U+2A3D, U+29B7 (not available in XCharter-Math).
